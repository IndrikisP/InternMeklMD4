    <h1>Latvia</h1>
    <p>Latvia is a country located in Europe. More specifically in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states">Baltic</a> region of Northern Europe</p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.latvia.eu/">Latvia</a> has a temperate seasonal climate. Its capital is <a href="https://indrikis1.wordpress.com/riga/">Riga</a>. Bordering <a href="https://indrikis1.wordpress.com/estonia/">Estonia</a> to the North, Lithuania to the East, Belarus to the South East and Russia to the East. Latvia became an independent country on 18 November 1918 and had its independence taken, which was later restored again only in  </p>
    <p> The climate is influenced by the prevailing southwesterly winds coming from the Atlantic. Humidity is high, and the skies are usually cloudy; there are only about 30 to 40 days of sunshine per year. Average precipitation usually exceeds 20 inches (about 500 mm) on the lowlands and may approach or exceed 30 inches (about 760 mm) on the uplands.</p>
    <h2> Latvian language </h2>
    <p> Latvian is an eastern Baltic language that belongs to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. It's the official language of Latvia. There are approximately 1.2 million speakers in Latvia and 100,000 abroad. 
    <h3> Is Latvian a hard language to learn? </h3>
    <p> Latvian is considered one of the hardest languages. The fact that it's one of the only two languages in the Baltic branch adds to the complexity of learning it. Latvian might be easy to learn if you already speak Lithuanian. Some would argue that it is easier for a Lithuanian to learn Latvian, than a Latvian to learn Lithuanian. But all would agree that these 2 languages are very similar. </p>
    <p>Latvian grammar represents a classic Indo-European (Baltic) system with well developed inflection and derivation. Primary word stress, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, is on the first syllable. There are no articles in Latvian; definiteness is expressed by an inflection of adjectives. Basic word order in Latvian is subject–verb–object; however, word order is relatively free.</p>
    <p>Latvian belongs to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is one of two living Baltic languages with an official status (the other being Lithuanian). The Latvian and <a href="https://indrikis1.wordpress.com/lithuanian_baltic_language">Lithuanian</a> languages have retained many features of the nominal morphology of Proto-Indo-European, though their phonology and verbal morphology show many innovations (in other words, forms that did not exist in Proto-Indo-European), with Latvian being considerably more innovative than Lithuanian. However, Latvian has been also influenced by the Livonian language. For example, Latvian borrowed first-syllable stress from Finno-Ugric languages.</p>
